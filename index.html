  Arc Reactor

  The Arc Reactor was a fusion type power source featuring a palladium core, and was the initial power
  Arc Reactor V1


  Iron Man 3
  source of the first Iron Man Mark suits, and was later modified to an advanced level by Tony to power his more advanced suits, as it kept on improving. During the events of Iron Man II Tony re-discovered and synthesized a new element theorized by Howard Stark, as a clean and safe core alternative to palladium core. This not only stopped palladium poisoning of Tony's body but also reversed its effects, saving his life.

  Stark Industries HQ in Los Angeles was once powered by an Arc Reactor, but it was destroyed when Pepper overloaded it and Obadiah Stane with his Iron Monger Armor fell into the reactor. It is unknown what happened to the reactor after this event.

  The Arc Reactor is also the power source of Stark Tower (Later moved underground and the tower was renamed Avengers Tower) and a miniturized arc reactor was created to power the Iron Man suit.
